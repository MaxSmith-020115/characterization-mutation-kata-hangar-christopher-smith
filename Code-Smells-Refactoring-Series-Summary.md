# Code Smells → Characterization & Mutation Testing → Refactoring

This 3-part hands-on series takes you on a journey from **Detecting problems in code** 
to **Protecting behavior with safety nets** and finally to **Correcting design and structure with safe 
refactoring**—so that working in your code becomes easier, safer, and joyful to maintain. 
Each session builds on the last, giving you confidence to work with legacy code fearlessly and effectively.

---

## 👃 Session #1: Code Smells (Detect)
- **Theme:** Why does some code just feel harder to work with?  
- **Focus:** Spot unhealthy patterns that make code risky or confusing.  
- **Outcomes:** Sharpen detection, recognize common smells (long methods, clutter, duplication, bad names), and make code easier, safer, and more joyful to maintain.  
- **You’ll leave with:** A sharper eye for hidden problems and a common vocabulary to talk about them.

## 🛡️ Session #2: Characterization & Mutation Testing (Protect)
- **Theme:** How do we change code with confidence?  
- **Focus:** Build safety nets with characterization tests and strengthen them with mutation testing.  
- **Outcomes:** Lock in current behavior, shorten feedback loops, and trust your tests to catch surprises.  
- **You’ll leave with:** Confidence that your tests can guard against regressions and highlight blind spots.

## ✅ Session #3: Refactoring (Correct)
- **Theme:** Now that we can spot problems and protect behavior, how do we safely improve code?  
- **Focus:** Make disciplined, small, safe changes without altering behavior.  
- **Outcomes:** Apply common refactorings, such as: remove clutter, extract method, rename, replace magic numbers, and more.  
- **You’ll leave with:** Hands-on experience turning messy code into clearer, more maintainable code.
